            solar panels save homeowners a lot of money. When you install solar
            panels at home, you receive a 26% federal tax credit. We design
            solar panels systems that are in compliance with all federal
            reporting regulations in order to take full advantage of this tax
            program.

            when you finance your solar panels, you might be eligible for a $0
            down payment but will still have a monthly payment. The savings over
            your panels useful life are less than a direct purchase, but also
            significant in their own right. The best part? Your payments will
            end eventually, and your electric bill will be extremely reduced or
            eliminated.

            solar power offers protection from high energy rates and steadily
            rising electricity costs. Adding solar panels to your home is a
            long-term, low risk, high return way to invest your money. You get
            an initial tax-free annual return on investment from 30% to 40%. As
            utility rates increase, the annual return increases. Solar energy
            will also free you from the utility company's dependence on the
            fossil fuel marketplace.

            no matter how small your solar panel system is, it has a significant
            environmental impact. When you get solar panels at home and generate
            electricity from clean, you are reducing fossil fuel consumption and
            the emission of harmful pollutants. Â¡Let's leave future generations
